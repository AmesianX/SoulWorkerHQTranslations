### Soul Worker HQ JP Version Translations
Homepage: http://soulworkerhq.com

## How to contribute?
  1. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0elCk6HCY5XkLg0t) and PM Miyu or Hiromi.
  2. For now we are using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/hiromi-corp/swhq) to translate for now because there are lots of edits to be made.

## GUIDELINES for Transifex
  1. If a translation exists already for that line, ask about it on Discord or add a suggestion to the line.
  2. Do NOT remove any parameters (ex. {0}, {1}), in those come Character Names, Areas, etc...
  3. Keep "\n"s, they represent a Line Feed (new line) in game.
  4. Do NOT edit the lines starting with "ID=" and do NOT translate them.
  5. Additional questions can be asked on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0elCk6HCY5XkLg0t)
  6. Use ASCII (English) commas, dots, exclamation/question marks, etc...
  7. Keep Japanese Onomatopoeias and Japanese honorifics in translations. (ex. Onee-chan, Auauau)
